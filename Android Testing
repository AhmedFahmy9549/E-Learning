Unit testing:

            Unit testing for Android can be classified into:  
            
             * Local unit tests - tests which can run on the JVM.
             * Instrumented unit tests - tests which require the Android system.

        Note: If you write local unit test and have dependencies to Android API, you need to replace them, e.g., via a mocking framework like Mockito
        
        
  * 70-80 % unit tests to ensure stability of your code basis
  * 20-30 % functional tests to ensure that the application really works
  * 10 % some cross functional tests if your application integrates intensively with other Application components    
  
  
    
    AndroidJUnitRunner:  ( tool for Android testing)
             
           The library provides a JUnit 4-compatible test runner (AndroidJUnitRunner), the Espresso test framework and the UI Automator test framework.
                       
                    * Espresso : test framework can be used to test the User Interface of your application
                    * UI Automator allows to write cross application functional tests.
                    
                    
         AndroidJunitRunner provides access to the instrumentation API, via the InstrumentationRegistery.
        
              - InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation(), returns the Instrumentation currently running.
              - InstrumentationRegistry.getContext(), returns the Context of this Instrumentationâ€™s package.
              - InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext(), returns the application Context of the target application.
              - InstrumentationRegistry.getArguments(), returns a copy of arguments Bundle that was passed to this Instrumentation. This is useful when you want to access the command line arguments passed to the instrumentation for your test.

    
          * app/src/main/java- for your source code of your main application build
          * app/src/test/java - for any unit test which can run on the JVM
          * app/src/androidTest/java - for any test which should run on an Android device


    A unit tests for an Android application can be:

       - local unit test - which runs on the JVM
       - Android unit test - which runs on the Android runtime
